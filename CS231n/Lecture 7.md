# Lecture 7 Detailed Study Notes

## Introduction to Image Classification

### What is Image Classification?

- **Task:** Assign an input image (a grid of pixel values) to one of a fixed set of categories (e.g., dog, cat, truck, plane).
- **Image Representation:**  
  - Images are 3D arrays: height × width × 3 (for RGB channels).
  - Each pixel value is a number between 0 and 255 (brightness).

### Why is Image Classification Hard?

- **Semantic Gap:**  
  - Computers see only numbers (pixel values), not high-level concepts.
- **Variability Factors:**
  - **Camera properties:** Rotation, zoom, shift, different focal properties.
  - **Illumination:** Lighting changes can dramatically affect pixel values.
  - **Deformation:** Objects (like cats) appear in many poses and shapes.
  - **Occlusion:** Objects may be partially hidden.
  - **Background clutter:** Objects may blend into complex backgrounds.
  - **Intraclass variation:** Large differences within a single class (e.g., many cat breeds).
- **Complexity:**  
  - Algorithms must handle the cross-product of all these variations.
  - Modern algorithms can classify thousands of categories at near-human accuracy in milliseconds.

## Approaches to Image Classification

### Explicit (Rule-Based) Approaches

- **Early Methods:**  
  - Encode rules (e.g., "detect cat ears by finding certain edge arrangements").
- **Problems:**  
  - Unscalable: Need new rules for every new object class.
  - Not generalizable.

### Data-Driven (Machine Learning) Approaches

- **Modern Approach:**  
  - Use large datasets and statistical learning.
- **Workflow:**
  1. **Training phase:** Collect many labeled examples for each class.
  2. **Model training:** Learn a model from the data.
  3. **Testing phase:** Use the trained model to classify new, unseen images.
- **Advantage:**  
  - Scalable and adaptable to many classes and variations.

## Example Dataset: CIFAR-10

- **Classes:** 10 (e.g., airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck).
- **Size:** 50,000 training images, 10,000 test images.
- **Image Size:** 32×32 pixels, RGB (small, "thumbnail" images).

---

## Nearest Neighbor Classifier

### Basic Idea

- **Training:**  
  - Store all training images and their labels.
- **Testing:**  
  - For a test image, find the most similar image in the training set.
  - Assign the label of the nearest training image to the test image.

### How It Works

1. For each test image:
   - Compute a similarity (or distance) metric to every training image.
   - Find the training image with the smallest distance (most similar).
   - Assign the label of this nearest neighbor.

---

## Distance Metrics

### Manhattan (L1) Distance

- **Definition:**  
  - Also called "L1 distance" or "Manhattan distance".
  - For two images, sum the absolute differences of pixel values.
- **Formula:**  
  \[
  L_1(x, y) = \sum_{i} |x_i - y_i|
  \]
  Where \(x\) and \(y\) are the flattened pixel arrays of the two images.
- **Interpretation:**  
  - \(L_1 = 0\) if images are identical.
  - Larger values mean more dissimilar images.

---

## Implementation: Nearest Neighbor Classifier in NumPy

### Training Phase

- Simply store the training images (\(X\)) and their labels (\(y\)) as class attributes.
- No computation is done at training time (just memorization).

### Prediction Phase

- For each test image:
  - Compute the L1 distance to every training image (vectorized for efficiency).
  - Find the index of the training image with the smallest distance.
  - Assign the label of the nearest training image.

### Example Vectorized Code
X_train: (num_train, D)

X_test: (num_test, D)

for i in range(num_test):

distances = np.sum(np.abs(X_train - X_test[i, :]), axis=1)

min_index = np.argmin(distances)

y_pred[i] = y_train[min_index]



- **Note:**  
  - This code avoids explicit nested loops by using NumPy's vectorized operations, making it much faster.

## Key Takeaways

- Image classification is challenging due to the semantic gap and variability in images.
- Rule-based approaches are unscalable; data-driven machine learning is the modern solution.
- The nearest neighbor classifier is a simple, intuitive baseline:
  - Requires no training computation, just storage.
  - Classification is based on a distance metric (L1/Manhattan distance).
  - Efficient implementation relies on vectorized operations in NumPy.
