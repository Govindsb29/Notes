# Chapter 4: Text Classification — Extremely Detailed Study Notes

These notes cover all major concepts, methods, and insights from Chapter 4 ("Text Classification") of *Hands-On Large Language Models: Language Understanding and Generation* by Jay Alammar & Maarten Grootendorst. They are designed to serve as a comprehensive resource for exam preparation and open-book MCQ tests.

## Overview and Motivation

- **Text classification** is the process of assigning predefined categories (labels) to text documents.
- Foundational in NLP, enabling:
  - Sentiment analysis (e.g., positive/negative movie reviews)
  - Spam detection
  - Topic categorization
  - Intent detection in chatbots
- Modern pretrained language models are leveraged for these tasks, focusing on both *representation* (encoder-based) and *generative* (decoder-based) models.

---

## The Sentiment of Movie Reviews

- **Sentiment analysis** is a classic example of text classification.
- **Task:** Given a movie review, predict if the sentiment is positive or negative.
- **Datasets:** IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Amazon Reviews.
- **Challenges:**
  - Sarcasm, negation, context sensitivity.
  - Domain adaptation (movie reviews vs. product reviews).

---

## Text Classification with Representation Models

- **Representation models** (encoder-only, like BERT) convert input text into dense vector representations (embeddings).
- **Workflow:**
  1. Input text is tokenized and embedded.
  2. A special token (often `[CLS]`) is used to represent the whole sequence.
  3. The embedding of this token is fed into a classifier (often a simple feedforward layer).
- **Fine-tuning:** The model is trained (or fine-tuned) on labeled data for the specific classification task.
- **Advantages:**
  - High accuracy with relatively small labeled datasets.
  - Transfer learning: pretrained models already encode a lot of language knowledge.

---

## Model Selection

- **Choosing a model** depends on:
  - Task complexity (binary vs. multiclass vs. multilabel).
  - Data size (small datasets may benefit from larger, pretrained models).
  - Computational resources.
- **Popular encoder models:**
  - BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
  - RoBERTa
  - DistilBERT (smaller, faster)
- **Considerations:**
  - Larger models may perform better but are slower and require more memory.
  - Distilled or quantized models are useful for deployment.

---

## Using a Task-Specific Model

- **Task-specific models** are pretrained on data similar to the target task.
- **Examples:**
  - Sentiment-specific BERT variants.
  - Domain-adapted models (e.g., BioBERT for biomedical text).
- **Benefits:**
  - Improved performance due to domain knowledge.
  - Faster convergence during fine-tuning.

---

## Classification Tasks That Leverage Embeddings

- **Embeddings** can be used directly for classification, especially when labeled data is limited.
- **Approaches:**
  - Compute embeddings for all documents.
  - Use a simple classifier (logistic regression, SVM, etc.) on top of embeddings.
- **Zero-shot and few-shot classification:**
  - Use embeddings to compare input text to label descriptions.
  - Example: Assign the label whose description embedding is closest to the input text embedding (cosine similarity).

---

## Supervised Classification

- **Supervised learning** requires labeled datasets.
- **Training process:**
  1. Split data into training, validation, and test sets.
  2. Fine-tune the model on the training set.
  3. Evaluate using metrics like accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall.
- **Common loss function:** Cross-entropy loss.
- **Overfitting:** Use regularization, dropout, early stopping.

---

## What If We Do Not Have Labeled Data?

- **Unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches:**
  - Use clustering or topic modeling to group similar documents.
  - Use self-supervised learning (e.g., predicting masked words).
- **Active learning:** Iteratively label the most informative samples.
- **Transfer learning:** Use models pretrained on related tasks.

---

## Text Classification with Generative Models

- **Generative models** (decoder-only, like GPT) can also perform classification.
- **Approaches:**
  - **Prompt-based classification:** Frame the task as a text generation problem.
    - Example prompt: `Review: [text]. Sentiment: [MASK]` — the model predicts "positive" or "negative."
  - **Few-shot classification:** Provide a few examples in the prompt (in-context learning).
- **Advantages:**
  - No need for explicit fine-tuning.
  - Flexible to new tasks (zero-shot, few-shot).
- **Disadvantages:**
  - May require careful prompt engineering.
  - Generally slower and less efficient for large datasets.

---

## Using the Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5)

- **T5** reframes all NLP tasks as text-to-text.
- For classification:
  - Input: `"Classify the sentiment of this review: [text]"`
  - Output: `"positive"` or `"negative"`
- **Benefits:**
  - Unified architecture for many tasks.
  - Easy to adapt to new tasks by changing the prompt.

---

## ChatGPT for Classification

- **ChatGPT and similar LLMs** can be used for classification via prompting.
- **Process:**
  - Provide the text and ask for a label.
  - Optionally, give examples to guide the model.
- **Evaluation:**
  - Can be surprisingly effective for many tasks.
  - Not as consistent as fine-tuned models for large-scale deployment.
